 gluckserwelde.1.desc:0 "Skorzeny—the co-leader of Ostland, having heard about the expanding Polish influence on Ostland and its potential prospects of becoming Polish claim, fled to Memel to create a nation called "Glückserwelde". The territory had been just recently unclaimed. Skorzeny had been staunchly against Polish annexation of Ostland, and rather preferred staying independent, or becoming an AB-Aftonstaat under Baumer. Though we have been connected to Skorzeny for seasons now, it is not apparent if he will return to us."
