 PLN_warszawa_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_walter_texticon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarszawa, the crown jewel of the nation and the personal project of Walter. Here lies the adminstration and the bulk of the industry of the nation. With Walter developing it nonstop, the more the city develops—the less the people will want to go to war. As this is a project of great vanity, the people don't want to lose it to a foreign power.\n\nDespite this, people are willing to defend it to any means necessary in a time of war. Polish members know the ins and outs of the city, every corner, every sewer and every window. Thus the defenders would have a huge advantage in a defending position. Weapon caches stored underground in Warszawa also mean, that the army can act autonomously without needing to rely on supply depot in another location."

 PLN_riga_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_koko_texticon £GFX_skorzeny_texticon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiga, while it does have great architecture in it, is relatively small, and most of its importance is more centered around the slimefun industry. Here lays the development of several miners, oil wells and clay farms.\n\nWithin its borders, Riga also has weapon caches underground designated for future fighters, making it self-sufficient in gear in times of war. Though, if war does reach this city, it would be relatively dangerous to defend it due to the position of the settlement. It is a small urbanised area with plains around it and a coast, leaving it open to not only air attacks, but also naval and artillery. "
